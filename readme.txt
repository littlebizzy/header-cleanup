#### The Long Version ####

WordPress Core includes several meta items in the header that many sites don't require. For cleaner and simpler code, this plugin is recommended to help simplify your header for SEO and general code cleanliness.

The problem with many "cleanup" plugins with WordPress is that they don't focus on one purpose, but rather mix and match various goals in a confusing manner; for example they might remove some "junk code" from the header, but also totally disable the functionality of a built-in Core function too such as the REST API or RSS feeds. Since our goal is to be hyper organized and clear about each of our plugin's goals, keep in mind that this plugin's sole purpose is to cleanup source code in the header and is not meant to actually disable any functionality. Instead, if you wish to disable certain functions, you can install this plugin alonside our other plugins such as Disable Emojis, Disable XML-RPC, Disable Embeds, Disable REST API, Disable Feeds, etc.

All of the following are completely removed:

* `rsd_link`
* `wp_generator` 
* `wc_generator_tag`
* `wlwmanifest_link`
* `wp_shortlink_wp_head`
* `start_post_rel_link`
* `parent_post_rel_link`
* `index_rel_link`
* `adjacent_posts_rel_link`
* `adjacent_posts_rel_link_wp_head`
* `feed_links`
* `feed_links_extra`
* `rest_output_link_wp_head`
* `wp_resource_hints`

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

#### Nag Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first is a notice that fires during plugin activation which recommends several related free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear approximately once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear approximately once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel that these notices are too annoying, than we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the defined constant mentioned below inside of your `wp-config.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This defined constant will only affect the notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices that communicate with admin-level users.
